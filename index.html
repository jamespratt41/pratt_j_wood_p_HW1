        <p>
          Hey, call me Phil or Philip, either work. There isn't too much to say about myself, I'm either at work or at school. <br> I like to play video games, and I enjoy playing dungeons and dragons when I have the time. I also like traveling, <br> and I plan on going somewhere south on our Christmas break. In the summer I'm thinking about going someplace <br> in Europe, probably Italy because I really wanty to visit Rome.
