            JAMES PRATT
          </h2>
        <p>
          My name is James Pratt and I'm really excited for what this year holds.<br>
          My time is normally spent playing volleyball with the Fanshawe varsity team, or playing videogames such as Fortnite.<br>
          Coding is one of my passion that I truly do wish to learn as much as I can.<br>
          I'm new to web design, but my background in database work and videogame creation hopefully will transfer over!<br>
          Like I said before I can't wait to see what this year holds!<br>
          One of my favourite movies is "Step Brothers", as seen by the image below.<br>

          PHILIP WOOD
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hey, call me Phil or Philip, either work. There isn't too much to say about myself, I'm either at work or at school.
           <br> I like to play video games, and I enjoy playing dungeons and dragons when I have the time. I also like traveling,
            <br> and I plan on going somewhere south on our Christmas break. In the summer I'm thinking about going someplace <br>
             in Europe, probably Italy because I really wanty to visit Rome.
        </p>
